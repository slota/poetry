# Still I Rise

## Verse 1
You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

## Verse 2

## Verse 3
Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin' in my own back yard.
